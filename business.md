Got it — let’s break this into **two buckets**:

1. **What belongs on the public-facing website** (to attract and convert clients).
2. **What’s good to write down privately** (to remind yourself how to run and grow the business).

---

## ✅ Public-Facing Website Essentials

### **Homepage**

- **Clear Value Proposition**: One sentence that explains what you do (e.g. _“We transform messy business processes into streamlined, automated systems.”_).
- **Call to Action**: A button like “Book a Free Discovery Session.”
- **Mini Case Studies/Examples**: Short before → after stories (HireTalk, Thriveworks, Hockey platform).
- **Trust Signals**: Client logos, testimonials, or metrics (uptime, time saved, engagement boost).

### **About Page**

- **Mission Statement**: Not corporate fluff — something simple and human about why you started this.
- **Your Story**: Who you are, why you love solving complex business problems.
- **Philosophy**: Your process (Discovery → Prototype → Solution).

### **Services / Solutions Page**

- Break into 2–4 categories:

  - **Automation & Optimization** (workflows, AI, integrations).
  - **Custom Platforms** (dashboards, portals, apps).
  - **Consulting & Strategy** (process mapping, system design).

- For each: a short blurb, example tech used, and outcome for the client.

### **Case Studies / Portfolio**

- 2–4 detailed stories:

  - The problem.
  - The solution you built.
  - The measurable impact (time saved, costs reduced, revenue unlocked).

### **Process Page**

- Lay out your workflow:

  1. Free discovery session.
  2. Prototype or proof of concept.
  3. Build + iterate.
  4. Launch + support.

### **Contact / CTA Page**

- Calendly or booking link for a discovery call.
- Email + phone.
- FAQ section answering things like: _How do you charge? How long does a typical project take?_

## 🗂️ Internal “Business Playbook” (Not public, but critical)

This can live in Notion, Google Docs, or a private part of your site.

- **Mission Statement** (why you exist).
- **Vision** (what success looks like in 3–5 years).
- **Business Plan**:

  - Target market (who you’re serving).
  - Service tiers (what you offer at \$X, \$Y, \$Z).
  - Pricing model (project-based, retainer, hourly).
  - Growth strategy (referrals, partnerships, content).

- **Client Journey Map**: Step-by-step of what happens from first contact to final delivery.
- **Proposal & Contract Templates**: So you’re not reinventing the wheel every time.
- **Financial Plan**: Revenue goals, expense tracking, monthly burn.
- **Marketing Plan**:

  - Website content.
  - Social media strategy (Gary Vee style: “jab jab jab, right hook”).
  - Lead generation (AI email campaigns, referrals, LinkedIn outreach).

- **Personal Reminders**:

  - Always start with discovery.
  - Prototype early.
  - Over-communicate progress.
  - Don’t undersell your value.

👉 Think of it this way:

- **Website = Attract + Convert.**
- **Playbook = Guide + Run your business.**
